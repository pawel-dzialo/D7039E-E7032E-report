--week 3--

2022-09-12 Classroom meeting and working a bit with the data formatting.

Rest of the week:
Sick and staying at home. Sporadically working on the code and reading up on old material from the AI-courses. At the end of the week I had implemented the first neural network, although it still had a few errors.
