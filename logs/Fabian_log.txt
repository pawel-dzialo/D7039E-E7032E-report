--week 1--

2022-08-29 Course introduction

2022-08-30 Inital group meeting, later a classroom meeting. I also set up a test environment in Python.

2022-09-01 Meeting with Johan, making a general game plan.

2022-09-02 Held a thorough introduction to Neural networks in general and CNNs in particular for Johan. Further developing the game plan and working a bit with the test environment.

--week 2--

2022-09-05 Classroom meeting followed by a bit of casual planning. Pawel promises to make a Python-function I got stuck at earlier.

2022-09-06 Working a lot with the code. Implementing Pawels function and successfully read all data and begin formatting it to fit a neural network.

2022-09-07 Testing the helmet in practice and further developing the game plan from the new knowledge gained.

2022-09-09 Literature studies and meeting with Foteini.

--week 3--

2022-09-12 Classroom meeting and working a bit with the data formatting.

Rest of the week:
Sick and staying at home. Sporadically working on the code and reading up on old material from the AI-courses. At the end of the week I had implemented the first neural network, although it still had a few errors.

--week 4--

2022-09-19 Still sick. Sitting down together with Johan over voice-chat. Discussing and refining the game plan in detail, and also ironing out the bugs in the code from last week. First working neural network.

Rest of the week:
Sick and staying at home. Only working with the code a little bit.

--week 5--

2022-09-26 Classroom meeting, and later a meeting with Johan and Michelle, planning and deciding how we would structure and preprocess a dataset for our first real model. Discussing alternative methods.

2022-09-27 Group meeting, getting everyone up to speed, and preparing for our meeting with Foteini.

2022-09-28 Casual meeting with Johan, discussing and discarding alternative methods.

2022-10-02 Setting up environment in C++ to work in a new language, since we basically got stuck in python (because everything in python is so poorly optimized, generating proper datasets would take hours. Rewriting everything from scratch would take a week or two, but would mean almost instant new datasets.).

--week 6--

Early week: Sick and staying at home. Reading up on the inner workings of the EDF file format, and planning on how to make a dataset generator in c++.

2022-10-07 Working in c++ to try and make a dataset generator by reading EDF files and then pumping out "properly" formatted datasets. Specifically working on rewriting the datawindow code and formatting the project.

2022-10-09 Continued working in c++. Specifically rewriting the code to open the seizure files.

--week 7--

2022-10-10 Working in c++. Specifically working on fixing the dataset generation and fixing the datawindow code further. The dataset generator is basically done, but it doesn't export to a file yet.

2022-10-11 Experimenting with embedding python into c++ to potentially speed up the entire process further, to avoid having to go between different programs and files. Also starting to set up a GUI for the generator.

2022-10-12 Continuing to work with the GUI of the program, and setting up multithreading capabilities to run GUI separate from generation, and separate from a potential future python execution in the same program.

2022-10-13 Implementing the export-to-file functionality in c++ and import-from-file functionality in python for the dataset. FINALLY testing the first "properly trained" CNN, and getting a terrible result. But now, since everything is already set up, it should be easy to rapidly iterate.

2022-10-14 Group meeting, cathching up on what we have been doing. Also discussing new things we could try.

--week 8--

2022-10-17 Classroom meeting. Starting to rewrite the code to handle a rectangular window size.

2022-10-18 Continuing the work from the previous day.

Later that week: Busy in other course

--week 9--

Early week: Working a bit on the presentation, and only a little bit with the code.

2022-10-26 Preparing presentation and finishing the rectangular window code for both Python and C++.

2022-10-27 Presentation

--week 10--

2022-10-31 Weekly meeting

Later that week: Attempting to train the CNN so that it gives an OK result. Had massive problems with the Python IDE, including potential malware, so I might try to transfer everything to C++, but that would require an large amount of work.
