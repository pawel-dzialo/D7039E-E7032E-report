--week 1--

2022-08-29 Course introduction

2022-08-30 Inital group meeting, later a classroom meeting. I also set up a test environment in Python.

2022-09-01 Meeting with Johan, making a general game plan.

2022-09-02 Held a thorough introduction to Neural networks in general and CNNs in particular for Johan. Further developing the game plan and working a bit with the test environment.

--week 2--

2022-09-05 Classroom meeting followed by a bit of casual planning. Pawel promises to make a Python-function I got stuck at earlier.

2022-09-06 Working a lot with the code. Implementing Pawels function and successfully read all data and begin formatting it to fit a neural network.

2022-09-07 Testing the helmet in practice and further developing the game plan from the new knowledge gained.

2022-09-09 Literature studies and meeting with Foteini.

--week 3--

2022-09-12 Classroom meeting and working a bit with the data formatting.

Rest of the week:
Sick and staying at home. Sporadically working on the code and reading up on old material from the AI-courses. At the end of the week I had implemented the first neural network, although it still had a few errors.

--week 4--

2022-09-19 Still sick. Sitting down together with Johan over voice-chat. Discussing and refining the game plan in detail, and also ironing out the bugs in the code from last week. First working neural network.

Rest of the week:
Sick and staying at home. Only working with the code a little bit.

--week 5--

2022-09-26 Classroom meeting, and later a meeting with Johan and Michelle, planning and deciding how we would structure and preprocess a dataset for our first real model. Discussing alternative methods.

2022-09-27 Group meeting, getting everyone up to speed, and preparing for our meeting with Foteini.

2022-09-28 Casual meeting with Johan, discussing and discarding alternative methods.

2022-10-02 Setting up environment in C++ to work in a new language, since we basically got stuck in python (because everything in python is so poorly optimized, generating proper datasets would take hours. Rewriting everything from scratch would take a week or two, but would mean almost instant new datasets.).

--week 6--

Early week: Sick and staying at home. Reading up on the inner workings of the EDF file format, and planning on how to make a dataset generator in c++.

2022-10-07 Working in c++ to try and make a dataset generator by reading EDF files and then pumping out "properly" formatted datasets. Specifically working on rewriting the datawindow code and formatting the project.

2022-10-09 Continued working in c++. Specifically rewriting the code to open the seizure files.

--week 7--

2022-10-10 Working in c++. Specifically working on fixing the dataset generation and fixing the datawindow code further. The dataset generator is basically done, but it doesn't export to a file yet.

2022-10-11 Experimenting with embedding python into c++ to potentially speed up the entire process further, to avoid having to go between different programs and files. Also starting to set up a GUI for the generator.

2022-10-12 Continuing to work with the GUI of the program, and setting up multithreading capabilities to run GUI separate from generation, and separate from a potential future python execution in the same program.

2022-10-13 Implementing the export-to-file functionality in c++ and import-from-file functionality in python for the dataset. FINALLY testing the first "properly trained" CNN, and getting a terrible result. But now, since everything is already set up, it should be easy to rapidly iterate.

2022-10-14 Group meeting, cathching up on what we have been doing. Also discussing new things we could try.

--week 8--

2022-10-17 Classroom meeting. Starting to rewrite the code to handle a rectangular window size.

2022-10-18 Continuing the work from the previous day.

Later that week: Busy in other course

--week 9--

Early week: Working a bit on the presentation, and only a little bit with the code.

2022-10-26 Preparing presentation and finishing the rectangular window code for both Python and C++.

2022-10-27 Presentation

--week 10--

2022-10-31 Weekly meeting

Later that week: Attempting to train the CNN so that it gives an OK result. Had massive problems with the Python IDE, including potential malware, so I might try to transfer everything to C++, but that would require a large amount of work.

--week 11--

2022-11-07 Weekly meeting. Also finally got CNN to make properly distributed guesses. Still very much untuned, but this is promising.

2022-11-11 Group meeting. Discussing what we have been doing mostly.

Weekend: Successful CNN! Upwards of 98% accuracy on training data (unimportant), 67% accuracy on never before seen data (important). This can be improved further, but this is good enough to move on to implementing on the MCU. Exported result to ONNX file for potential test-implementation.

--week 12--

2022-11-14 Weekly meeting

2022-11-17 Making plan to improve accuracy, by skipping "ambiguous" data between 5 and 30 minutes before seizure, to get a clearer difference between pre and inter ictal.

2022-11-18 Group meeting, and also implementing the previous idea into code. Very successful. About 89% accuracy between pre and inter ictal, more than enough to make qualified predictions, especially if we take the average over a longer time. Later I also made a new dataset from a different person and tried guessing it with the same model, but as expected it did poorly. The model uses data from only one person. The new challenge is to make a general model that works for many different people.

--week 13--

2022-11-21 Weekly meeting

Rest of the week: No particular progress made, but general planning on how to make a general model. Once the pre-processing is done and implemented I will make a huge dataset and just try to train it "normally".

2022-11-27 Simulating a "real" test. However, the model now performs quite bad. The problem might be an inbalanced dataset where the inter-ictal data is tainted by brain activity from a test occasion loaded later, since that data is sorted out with even timesteps to match the data amount of the other types, and later data plays a bigger role. The model may therefore be cheating a bit by classifying between occasions rather than states.

--week 14--

2022-11-28 Continuing work from previous day

Rest of the week: Working on other courses, but still planning a little bit.

2022-12-04 Making a more balanced dataset for the model. It kind of works on the "real" test now, but is still reliant on having a lot of data from one single person. The big challenge to make a generalized model for multiple people is still ahead, and might not be possible with the way the current model is set up.

--week 15--

2022-12-05 Weekly meeting

2022-12-07 Meeting with Michelle and Johan. Talking about the implementation of the pre-processing into the dataset, and then also the neural network.

Rest of the week: Waiting for the code to be rewritten to fit the same structure as the dataset (has to be done before I can implement anything). Meanwhile working a lot on the other course.

2022-12-12 While waiting for the preprocessing I tried to improve the results of the "real" test, but the results are pretty weird. I might have a model that predicts a seizure, as it seems to always guess pre-ictal when a seizure is had on the same session, and always guess inter-ictal on sessions when no seizure was had. I will have to investigate this further.
