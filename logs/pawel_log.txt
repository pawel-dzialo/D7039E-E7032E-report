1040-1500 Working on Android app

28th september
1400-1940 Working on BLE drivers

30th september
1000-1400 Working on BLE stuff
1400-1430 Meeting
1430-1800 Working on BLE stuff

3rd october
0800-1015 Doing some experiments with spike detection as prediction algorithm
1015-1120 Scheduled meeting
1120-1630 Spike detection looked promising so we kept working on it

4th october
1020-1220  Adding some finishing touches to the BLE stuff. 

6th october
0800-1530  Adding finishing touches to BLE stuff, working on spike detection algorithm.

10th october
1300-1810 Working on spike detection algorithm mostly

8th october
0815-1500 Helping out with the spike detection while i work on some BLE stuff

13th october
1140-1240 Looking over the PCB draft

17th october
1015-1300 Planning how the data collection will be handled on MCU

21st october
1000-1700 Getting some prototype ADCs going with Johan A

24th October
1030-1900 Working on getting the ADCs talking with our MCU, managed to get it going will work on multiplexing next.

25th October
1400-1840 Got ADC multiplexing to work

26th October
1300-1940 Managed to increase frequency on the multiplexing to something viable, also plotted the readings of a generated sine wave to verify everything is actually working.

27th October
1330-1700 Improved the workflow for plotting ADC output, tested plotting the output of both ADCs with different waves as inputs simultaneously, which worked much better than expected considering we're running SPI at 20 MHz over a breadboard with probably 1m+ of total route length with no decoupling or filtering.
