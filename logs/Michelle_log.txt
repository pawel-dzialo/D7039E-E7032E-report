-----------Week 35-----------

Monday
  Meeting with the group where it was decided for each member to think over the project that has been given and how to structure the coming work. As well     in what area each member can contribute.

Tuesday
  Meeting with the whole lab group discussing: bottlenecks, given material, programming language, goal, goals,
  functionality (communication with device and mobile, GPS location, messenger) and approaches (machine learning, system identification etc)
  Literature study: Seizures and Epilepsy: An Overview for Neuroscientists, A neural-network-based detection of epilepsy

Wednesday
  Literature study, reading:
  Toward accurate prediction of epileptic seizures: A review

Thursday
  Literature study, taking notes and extracting relevant data:
  Toward accurate prediction of epileptic seizures: A review

--------------Week 36-------------------

Tuesday
  Meeting with Foetini and group.
  Discussing experimental setup.

Wednesday
  Setting up a stage schedule for the pre-processing of data based on one of the read literature.

Thursday
  Reading up on Notch filter and Butterworth filters.
  Trying to get data from database to be read properly for some processing trials.

-------------Week 37-------------------

Sick all week, only was able to work from home with my other course.

-------------Week 38-------------------

Monday
  Project check-up in classroom
  Discussing everyoneâ€™s progress and hardware ordering problem (long delivery times).

Tuesday
  Still trying to get the data from the database to comply.
  Uploading this log to GitHub.

Thursday
  Deciding filter frequencies (to begin with).
  Looking how to preprocess MNE data files (the one used by most EEG studies) in Python.
  Annotating good practices and functions for future use.
  
 Friday
  Writing Python code for the preprocessing
  Code logic that has been worked on: Import data, bandpass filtering and artifact removal.
  
  -------------Week 39-------------------
  
  Monday
    Project check-up in classroom.
    Project meeting, discussing everyone's progress so far.
    Neural network crew project meeting, discussing how to create a balanced dataset and data formatting for the NN.
  
  Tuesday
    Setting up the EEG lab environment in Matlab.
  
  Friday
    Report writing. Wrote parts in "Theory" and "Method", with citations.
    Constructed a flow-diagram that vizualizes the work flow of the project in overview.
    Pre-meeting with project group.
    Meeting with Fouteini.
    After-meeting with project group.
  
    -------------Week 40-------------------
    
    Monday
     Project check-up in classroom.
     Finished coding (python) the filtering and artifact removal (ICA).
     Exact variables vill very likely has to be tweaked depnding on prediction algorithms.
     Starting to look into FFT since it will be needed for atleast the neural network method.
     
    Friday
      Read up on Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs)
      Programmed a software FFT in python. 
      It works without issues but the transformed signal is a bit difficult to intepret.
      Should be fast enough to avoid having a hardware FFT since sampling is in 100-200 range.
      Transferred report writing I had already done from Git to the new Overleaf group document.
      Did another image for the report, this time a overview of how the cap will work.
