All the Hardware design and some simulation files.
The MCU_prototype is fully done with layout
Electrodes_proto is not done in layout preferably it should be done on a 4 layer PCB
but the capabilitys to create a PCB at the schools facilities makes it so It needs to be layed out using only two layer which makes it tough due to all power pins (V+ V-)

In the Simlulations:
Antialiasing,InsAmp,RCfilter is the main steps simulation individually
RC_amp_LP is the steps togheter
IN all sims not the exact components used in the circuitry have a simulation model so an equivalent part is used
but due to this the simulations are not 100% reliable and that why the main testing has been done in the lab.
