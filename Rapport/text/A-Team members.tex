%Short summary of team members and what you have done in the project
%\subsection{Pawel Dzialo}
%Responsible mostly for the software implementation on the MCU, as well as the simulator, and the Android app. Also had his hand in the spike detection algorithms, a small contribution to the CNN with a CHB-MIT database file reader, and some contribution to the hardware design, mostly the ADC multiplexing part, and some ideas for the overall PCB.

%\subsection{Fabian Danielsson}
%Responsible for making and training the CNN, with everything that entailed. That includes making the dataset, and through that also making the dataset generator that was used.

%\subsection{Johan Lindqvist}
%I am currently studying my last year of Engineering Physics and Electrical engineering. My main areas of interest are Control theory, Dynamical systems and signal processing. Basically, I love mathematics and its application to control, estimate or analyse systems. Due to these tendencies, I was set to work on the prediction algorithm, Did some initial work on machine learning but then shifted to completely focus on spike prediction methods. Collaborated with Pawel Dzialo on a spike frequency algorithm and then worked on improving these results, mainly by the Derivative based method proposed in this paper, as well as a matching filter in order to increase the accuracy of the spike frequencies.

%\subsection{Johan Axenhag}
%I currently study Engineering Physics and Electrical engineering with a master's in Electrical systems and Control engineering. For this project, I have mainly been involved with the electronics part with responsibility for the hardware both in designing the circuits for the data acquisition and for the data processing. During the first half of the course, most of the time was spent trying to understand the current hardware and finding components that could be used to achieve a similar result. During the second part of the course, most time went into designing and testing the different circuits. Additionally, finding and ordering parts was an additional responsibility.
